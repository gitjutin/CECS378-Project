# Assignment Tasks:

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OS-Level Concurrency Implementation
Use Python to implement concurrency in your system:

Use threads, multiprocessing, or asyncio to simulate concurrent tasks within components.

Include resource protection with synchronization primitives like:

Locks, Semaphores, Queues, or Event Objects.

Simulate race conditions and resolve them with correct synchronization.

Example (Smart Transportation):
A simulated traffic hub handles concurrent vehicle updates and signal control using threads and semaphores to prevent data corruption.


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication System
Redesign one or more parts of your system to work in a peer-to-peer model:

Every node must be capable of acting as both a client and server.

Use Python sockets, asyncio, or libraries like Pyre, libp2p, or Twisted.

Demonstrate:

Decentralized discovery or routing (e.g., each node holds partial network knowledge).

Scalability (add new peers without central registration).

Fault tolerance (handle dropped or unreachable peers).

Example (Smart Transportation):
Vehicles communicate with nearby peers to exchange location and route updates without a central traffic server.
